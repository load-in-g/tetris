# Console tetris. 
  This is a small console tetris application. I tried to to follow the official guidelines. However, not all necessary features have been implemented(for example, T-spins and combo-bonuses).
## Control:
  * Left and right arrows to move block horizontally.
  * Down arrow to soft drop block.
  * Up arrow or X to rotate block clockwise.
  * Z to rotate block counterclockwise.
  * SPACE to hard drop block.
  * RIGHT SHIFT to place the block in the backpack or swap the block with the block in the backpack.
## History
  Most of the code was written during a 3 hour flight, so the quality of the code leaves much to be desired.
